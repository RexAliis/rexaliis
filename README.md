Hello, welcome to my GitHub! My name is Aliis.

I am interested in the software engineer path. Currently, as a learning project, I'm working on .NET Discord, a robust and abstract library designed to interact with the Discord API.

If you ever want to chat, my Discord is `rexaliis`. Feel free to reach out!

  <summary>More About me</summary><br>
My name is Aliis. I am from Argentina, the land of mate, dulce de leche, and passionate soccer. I enjoy music, computing, tactical video games, and spending time with my pets. I’m shy but still enthusiastic.

### My daily routine
I like to accompany my daily routines with Lena Raine's music. I study computer science from home whenever I can, and in my free time, I learn music theory or watch VODs from [Woohoojin](https://www.youtube.com/@Woohoojin).

### About computing and the internet
I've had a strong passion for computer science for as long as I can remember. My first programming project was at the age of 13—a personal Discord bot made in Python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). After that, I explored various technologies until I was 15, when I came across tools like TypeScript, MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Electron. This is when I developed my first project, which, though disorganized and not very robust, helped me understand the field better: [AliisRPCMaker](https://github.com/RexAliis/AliisRPCMaker), a client for setting up custom Discord presences.

I also worked on other projects, such as plugins for [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/). At the same time, I became a [Discord Partner](https://discord.com/partners).

Two years passed, and I stepped away from computing, but I have now returned with a more professional focus. I’m working on a self-learning project called [.NET Discord](https://github.com/NETDiscord), a library developed in .NET C# with the goal of being both robust and appealing.
